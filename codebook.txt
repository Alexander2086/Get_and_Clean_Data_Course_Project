For the preparation of the data in dataset.txt it was used the data from the following link:


https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip


All the necessary information about the data used can be found in the .zip archive by the link above (file README.txt) or by the link below:


http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones


The data in the dataset.txt was obtained the following way:

 - test and train datasets were merged with parrallel assgning proper names to variables and factors
 - from all 561 variables (described in file features_info.txt of the .zip archive) the only variables measuring mean and standard deviation were choosen.
 - for each activity and each subject an average of each variable (chosen in p.2) was calculated.

So, the final dataset (dataset.txt) includes the following columns:

activity
subject.id
tBodyAccmeanX
tBodyAccmeanY
tBodyAccmeanZ
tBodyAccstdX
tBodyAccstdY
tBodyAccstdZ
tGravityAccmeanX
tGravityAccmeanY

tGravityAccstdY
tGravityAccstdZ
tBodyAccJerkmeanX

activity - is the type of activity the subject performed
subject.id - id of the person, taking part in the research

all the other - averages of the corresponding variables (I don't give their description here cause it is included in the links above - it's much better in all cases to get the info from primary source).
